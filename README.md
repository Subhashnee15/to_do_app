=> HTML Structure:

A simple input field (#task-input) to enter new tasks and a button (#add-task-btn) to add tasks to the list.
An unordered list (#task-list) where tasks will be displayed.

=> CSS Styling:

Styled to be clean, responsive, and visually appealing. Each task item has a "Delete" button to remove tasks, and tasks that are marked as completed get a strikethrough effect.

=> JavaScript Functionality:

1.Adding a Task: When a user enters text and clicks the "Add Task" button, the task is added to the list.
2. Marking a Task as Completed: Clicking on a task toggles its completion status by adding/removing a "completed" class, which applies a line-through style.
3. Deleting a Task: Each task has a delete button that removes it from the list.
4. Persistence: Tasks are saved in localStorage, so they persist across page reloads.
5.Running the Project:
i.Create the directory structure as mentioned above (/todo-app/index.html, /todo-app/style.css, /todo-app/script.js).
ii.Copy and paste the respective code into each file.
iii.Open index.html in your browser to see the interactive to-do list in action.
iv.Future Enhancements:
1.Add categories or priority levels to tasks.
2.Allow editing of existing tasks.
3.Sort tasks by completion status or creation time.
4.Add due dates and reminders.

==> This project demonstrates the ability to manipulate the DOM, handle events, use localStorage, and create a useful, interactive web application.
